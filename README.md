## What I Learned

This project was a deep dive into full-stack development. Here's a breakdown of my key learnings:

1. Next.js: Gained a solid understanding of server and client components, page design, and the separation of concerns between frontend and backend.
2. Appwrite: Learned how to use this Backend-as-a-Service platform for user authentication and NoSQL database management.
3. Type-Safe Development: Implemented a type-safe codebase using TypeScript and Zod for schema validation.
4. React Hook Form Proficiency: Built scalable and clean forms with comprehensive validation.
5. Error Monitoring with Sentry: Set up error tracking to identify and resolve issues proactively.
6. Plaid & Dwolla Integration: Successfully integrated these platforms to connect bank accounts and enable transfers.

PS: This was a training project, and no real bank accounts were used in the making of this app. It was followed along from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuOVqP_cjkE&t=2308s).
